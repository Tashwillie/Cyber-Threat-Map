### Goal
Build an open‑source “Cyber‑Attack Threat Map” web app that mimics Check Point’s public map (https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/) but uses ONLY permissive libraries and mock attack data.  
The project must run locally with:

- **Node 18 +**
- **TypeScript** on both client & server
- **Vite** for fast front‑end dev
- **ESM** everywhere (no CommonJS)
- **pnpm** workspace layout

### High‑level features
1. Real‑time 3‑D globe showing animated attack arcs.  
2. Socket.IO push of live (mock) attacks from the server.  
3. Simple HUD with total‑attacks counter and attack‑type legend.  
4. Responsive, full‑screen UI (desktop & mobile).  
5. Typed, documented, well‑formatted source.

### Required libraries
| Concern            | Lib                                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 3‑D globe          | `three`, `three‑globe`                      |
| Real‑time channel  | `socket.io` (server + client)               |
| Build tooling      | `vite`, `typescript`, `@types/node`         |
| Lint/format        | `eslint`, `prettier`, `husky` (pre‑commit)  |
| Utility            | `zod` for schema validation (attack events) |
